## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Before diving into writing SuperCodeX code, ensure you have the following:

1. **A Windows Machine** (SuperCodeX is primarily for Windows, though cross-platform support is possible in future versions).
2. **SuperCodeX Compiler** â€“ the core tool to transform SuperCodeX code into native executable code.
3. **Basic Text Editor** â€“ Use any text editor of your choice (Visual Studio Code, Sublime, etc.).

### **Installation**

#### 1. Download the SuperCodeX Compiler and Runtime:

Download the **latest release** of the SuperCodeX compiler and runtime environment.

#### 2. Install the Compiler:

Run the downloaded `.exe` and follow the installation instructions. The installation will include:
- The SuperCodeX compiler
- Compiler libraries and tools
- Example scripts for testing

#### 3. Set Up the Development Environment:

Once installed, ensure your environment variables are set correctly to access the SuperCodeX commands from anywhere in the command line.

- **Add SuperCodeX path to `PATH` environment variable** for easy access via terminal or command prompt.

#### 4. Verify Installation:

Open a terminal window and type:
```bash
supercodex --version
```
If installed correctly, you should see the version of the SuperCodeX compiler printed.

## **SuperCodeX Language Basics**

### **Syntax Overview**

SuperCodeX is a **high-level-to-low-level hybrid language**, designed to blend ease of use with maximum performance.

#### **Basic Syntax:**
```supercodex
print("Hello, SuperCodeX!")
```

#### **Variables & Memory Buffers:**
- **Variables** are defined with a keyword `var`, followed by the variable name and its value.  
- **Scoped Buffers** are memory chunks allocated for processing, and they are manually defined and managed for maximum efficiency.

Example:
```supercodex
var myVar = 10
buffer myBuffer(256) // Defines a memory buffer of 256 units
```

#### **Comments:**
SuperCodeX uses `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.
```supercodex
// This is a single-line comment
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

#### **Operators:**
SuperCodeX uses standard arithmetic and logical operators:
- **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Logical:** `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Bitwise:** `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`

#### **Control Flow:**
SuperCodeX supports standard control structures:
```supercodex
if (myVar > 5) {
    print("Value is greater than 5")
} else {
    print("Value is less than or equal to 5")
}
```

#### **Loops:**
```supercodex
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    print(i)
}

while (myVar > 0) {
    myVar -= 1
}
```

### **Key Constructs**

#### **Functions:**
Define functions using the `func` keyword.
```supercodex
func add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```

#### **Macros:**
SuperCodeX allows you to define macros that are expanded at compile-time:
```supercodex
macro SQUARE(x) {
    return x * x
}

var result = SQUARE(5)
```

---

## **Advanced Constructs**

### **Splicing Tunnels & Private Channels**

SuperCodeX supports **distributed execution** using **Splicing Tunnels** and **Private Channels**. These enable **edge computing** and **networking** for large-scale applications.

#### **Example of Splicing Tunnel:**
```supercodex
tunnel mainTunnel(srcNode, destNode) {
    // Sends data from srcNode to destNode
    data transfer(srcNode, destNode)
}
```

---

### **Error Handling (Cycling Deferral)**

SuperCodeX uses **cycling deferral** for error handling. Instead of failing immediately, errors are restructured until they are resolved.

#### **Example:**
```supercodex
func riskyOperation() {
    if (someConditionFails) {
        error("Condition failed!")
    }
}

try {
    riskyOperation()
} catch {
    // Cycle until executable
    retry()
}
```

---

## **Compilation & Execution**

### **Writing a Basic Program**

Let's write a simple program that prints "Hello, SuperCodeX!" to the console.

```supercodex
// Main Program
print("Hello, SuperCodeX!")
```

### **Running Your First Program**

To compile and run your program, use the SuperCodeX compiler:

```bash
supercodex compile yourFile.scdx
supercodex run yourFile
```

### **AOT Compilation**

SuperCodeX **AOT compiles** the program into **native machine code**, allowing for high-performance execution.

### **Viewing Output and Debugging**

If your program runs successfully, you will see output directly in the terminal. For debugging:
```bash
supercodex debug yourFile.scdx
```
This command provides detailed insights into the execution of your program, including variable states, memory usage, and error logs.

---

## **Optimizing Performance**

### **Reciprocal Parallelism**

SuperCodeX supports **parallel execution** by leveraging **reciprocal parallelism**. This means tasks can execute in parallel, speeding up computation-heavy processes.

#### Example:
```supercodex
parallel {
    task1()
    task2()
}
```

### **Helixical Garbage Collection**

SuperCodeX automatically handles **memory deallocation** through **Helixical Garbage Collection**. This ensures that memory is reclaimed efficiently after use.

### **Memory Management (Scoped Buffers)**

You define **memory buffers** scoped to specific sections of your code, which enhances **memory safety** and **performance**.

```supercodex
buffer buffer1(256)
{
    var temp = 100
    // Buffer memory automatically freed after scope
}
```

---

## **Advanced Usage**

### **Networking & Edge Computing**

SuperCodeX supports **distributed systems**, **edge computing**, and **networking** via **splicing tunnels**. This allows you to build scalable applications.

#### Example:
```supercodex
tunnel sendData(nodeA, nodeB, data) {
    // Transmit data from nodeA to nodeB
    dataTransfer(nodeA, nodeB, data)
}
```

### **Multitasking with Distributed Tunnels**

Use **private channels** for **multitasking**. This enables parallel processing across multiple machines or nodes.

```supercodex
channel mainChannel(nodeA, nodeB) {
    task1(nodeA)
    task2(nodeB)
}
```

---

## **SuperCodeX Runtime & Execution Environment**

### **Setting Up a Runtime Environment**

To run SuperCodeX code in an **execution environment**, you need the SuperCodeX runtime installed. This is automatically set up during the installation process.

### **Execution Table Generator**

The **execution table generator** converts SuperCodeX code into an optimized execution plan that will be executed directly from memory.

---

## **Building with SuperCodeX**

### **Compiler Setup**

Use the following **makefile** to automate compiling SuperCodeX projects:

```make
compile:
    supercodex compile $(SRC) -o $(OUT)
run:
    supercodex run $(OUT)
```

### **Distribution & Deployment**

SuperCodeX allows you to distribute compiled binaries directly. Use `supercodex build` to generate a distributable package.

---

## **Troubleshooting & Tips**

- **Error Messages:** If the compiler produces errors, read the error messages carefully. They typically point to **syntax issues** or **undefined references**.
- **Memory Leaks:** SuperCodeX has **automatic garbage collection**, but be sure to use **scoped buffers** to manage memory effectively.
- **Debugging:** Use `supercodex debug` to get detailed step-by-step output of your program.

---

## **Conclusion**

With this guide, you should now have the full tools to start developing with **SuperCodeX**. This language provides both **high-level constructs** for ease of use and **low-level control** for performance optimization. Whether you're building desktop applications, networking systems, or multitasking distributed systems, **SuperCodeX** is designed for speed, safety, and scalability.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
